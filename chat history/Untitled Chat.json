With my background in Artificial Intelligence and practical experience in data analysis, I am confident I possess the skills and qualifications necessary to contribute to your hyper-growth B Corp.\n\nMy MSc in Artificial Intelligence, coupled with my hands-on experience, has equipped me with a strong foundation in Python data-wrangling using pandas and NumPy. As demonstrated by my MSc Dissertation research where I developed an ETL pipeline to extract pose features and navigation metrics into dynamic graph structures and implemented S-TGNN models using PyTorch Geometric Temporal (PyGT), I have a proven ability to query, cleanse, and model datasets effectively.\n\nWhile my CV highlights my expertise in Python, I am also proficient in Excel. I have experience using Excel for creating data insights. During my time as a Project Engineer at Wipro Technologies, I developed custom automation tools using Python which were used to update configuration variables across multiple files, this improved engineering efficiency by up to 80%.\n\nI am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team's success. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPranup Chhetri\n"}]}
